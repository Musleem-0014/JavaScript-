I Create a HTML file named index.html with a <h1> that says:
"Learning JavaScript Basics"
And i also Created separate JavaScript files for each exercise:
exercise1.js
exercise2.js
exercise3.js
...
exercise7.js
exercise8.js

And I've also created a complete solutions for all 8 exercises for my CareerEx JavaScript basics assignment.
You can switch the src to the file you're testing.
For example:

<script src="exercise2.js"></script>

This makes it easier and less messy to run each script one at a time for you.
